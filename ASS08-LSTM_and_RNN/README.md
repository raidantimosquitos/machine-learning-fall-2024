# Speech Emotion Recognition using the RAVDESS dataset (featuring LSTM and RNN)

The following repository presents a implementation of LSTM and RNN Machine Learning models concatenated to perform a speech emotion recognition task using the [RAVDESS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio).

My model overfits, will have to take an approach to augment data, but the model is built.
