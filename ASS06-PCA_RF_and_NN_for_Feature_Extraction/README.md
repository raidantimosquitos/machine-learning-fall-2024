# Assignment 06: PCA, Random Forest and Neural Networks for feature extraction

The following assignment explores three topics:
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: It is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that is applied in exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data pre-processing. The original data is linearly transformed to a new coordinate system so that the directions (principal components) that capture the largest variation in the data are easily identified.
- **Random Forest**: It is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks. It creates multiple Decision Trees during the training process. In the case of a classification task the output of the model is the class selected by the most desicion trees. In regression problems, the output is the average of the predictions of all decision trees.
- **Neural Networks for Feature Extraction**: Neural networks exploit non-linear relations between the input samples, by feeding our dataset through a neural network we can obtain new features that might benefit the end model's task.
